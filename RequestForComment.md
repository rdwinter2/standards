# Request for Comment (RFC) at Flow

The RFC process at Flow is designed to allow individuals to propose changes / enhancements / additions to Flow Standards, with an opportunity to get feedback BEFORE a change is implemented.

## Goals

 - Have the right level of standard / process - including the ability to identify standards that we should AND should not adopt
 - Ensure that standards are truly adopted across Flow by raising visibility
 - Increase personal commitment to a standard by having the opportunity to contribute in the process

## When should I create an RFC? 

Create an RFC whenever considering a standard that may:

  - Need to be implemented by multiple people / teams
  - Or impact multiple people / teams
  - Or set implications / precedent on how we do things, whether operational or technical

## How to create an RFC

 1. Create a google doc in the [Tech RFC Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Euc4AHUKLXoRLAxXJGmOMSxkp1cj7pqH):
 1. Set title of doc to contain a prefix of "RFC: YYYY-MM"
 1. Start doc with:
    ```Status: Open for comments until Feb 5, 2017 at 5pm EST```
 1. Provide a minimum of 24 hours and 1 business day for comment
 1. Share the doc with tech@flow.io
 1. Include an "Expected Outcome" section to capture the anticipated positive improvements and potential negatives

After the deadline, update the status to one of:  "Adopting", "Not Adopting"

If adopting: Create a "Next Steps" section at end of highlighting the
actions with target dates. Come back to the RFC to update status on
each step as it is completed / changed.
